**Signature:**
```solidity
/// @notice Creates the market `marketParams`.
///  @dev Here is the list of assumptions on the market's dependencies (tokens, IRM and oracle) that guarantees
///  Morpho behaves as expected:
///  - The token should be ERC-20 compliant, except that it can omit return values on `transfer` and `transferFrom`.
///  - The token balance of Morpho should only decrease on `transfer` and `transferFrom`. In particular, tokens with
///  burn functions are not supported.
///  - The token should not re-enter Morpho on `transfer` nor `transferFrom`.
///  - The token balance of the sender (resp. receiver) should decrease (resp. increase) by exactly the given amount
///  on `transfer` and `transferFrom`. In particular, tokens with fees on transfer are not supported.
///  - The IRM should not re-enter Morpho.
///  - The oracle should return a price with the correct scaling.
///  - The oracle price should not be able to change instantly such that the new price is less than the old price
///  multiplied by LLTV*LIF. In particular, if the loan asset is a vault that can receive donations, the oracle
///  should not price its shares using the AUM.
///  @dev Here is a list of assumptions on the market's dependencies which, if broken, could break Morpho's liveness

///  - The amount of assets supplied and borrowed should not be too high (max ~1e32), otherwise the number of shares
///  might not fit within 128 bits.
///  - The IRM should not revert on `borrowRate`.
///  - The IRM should not return a very high borrow rate (otherwise the computation of `interest` in
///  `_accrueInterest` can overflow).
///  - The oracle should not revert `price`.
///  - The oracle should not return a very high price (otherwise the computation of `maxBorrow` in `_isHealthy` or of
///  `assetsRepaid` in `liquidate` can overflow).
///  @dev The borrow share price of a market with less than 1e4 assets borrowed can be decreased by manipulations, to
